# pitmenu

Simple ROM front end menu.

It is written in Python and uses pygame for the graphics layer.  It
uses SDL so it can be used from a Windowed environment on directly on
the console with a frame buffer.

# TODO

- convert to SDL2?  Does it exist in Raspbian?
  - [PySDL2](https://bitbucket.org/marcusva/py-sdl2) or
  - [pygame_sdl2](https://github.com/renpy/pygame_sdl2)
- Add a Favorites/Bookmarks menu
- Add a execve restart
